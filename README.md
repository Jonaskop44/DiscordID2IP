# About The Project

A simple website with which you can supposedly convert the Discord ID of a user to the IP of the user. In reality, however, it is an IP logger.

IMPORTANT, I am not responsible for anything. The website is for demonstration purposes only and I do not encourage anyone to use IP loggers, as storing IPs without the consent of the person is a punishable offense.
